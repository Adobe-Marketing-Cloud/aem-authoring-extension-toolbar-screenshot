# Adobe Experience Manager 6.2 Extension: Add a custom Toolbar Action in Sites Page Editor

This is a sample package showing how to create a custom Toolbar Action to render components. Thanks to [HTML2Canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) project

## Building 
 
This project uses Maven for building. Common commands:

From the project directory, run ``mvn clean install content-package:install`` to build the bundle and content package and install to a CQ instance.

## Using with VLT 
 
To use vlt with this project, first build and install the package to your local CQ instance as described above. Then cd to `src/main/content/jcr_root` and run

    vlt --credentials admin:admin co http://localhost:4502/crx/-/jcr:root . --force

Once the working copy is created, you can use the normal ``vlt up`` and ``vlt ci`` commands.
